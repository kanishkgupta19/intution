                   <p id="blog1" class="collapse">Faked A Stomach-ache We’ve all had that one morning where we absolutely did not want to go to school. However, our mothers wouldn’t let us miss school. So we all faked a stomache so we’d be able to stay back at home and laze around. 2.	Flaunted Stationery There’d always be one cool kid in every class who would get the funkiest pens and notebooks to school! Then would begin a never-ending process of everyone trying to match the level of the cool kid’s pencil box. Right when we’d be at par, the cool kid would replace his old things with even fancier tools! 3.	Pen Fights and Book Cricket We have all unleashed our inner Tendulkar and Dhoni while playing book cricket! The atmosphere of the classroom would be no less than Wankhede or Dharmshala! These simple games used to become so competitive! Pen Fights were taken very seriously, it was no joke! 4.	Passed Chits. This was our sole mean of communication in every lecture! I mean come on, how else were we supposed to discuss about where our meeting point to play later in the evening would be?! It’s an art to be able to fit long messages in small pieces of paper, pass it to your friend who is sitting three rows away from you and yet not get caught! Yes, we were all secret agents back then. 5.	Carved Artwork on Wooden Desks No, there was no shortage of paper or any other art supplies. We still carved the most elaborate works of art on our wooden desks with scales and pens. Back then we didn’t know that through our doodles were not decorating the desks; we were vandalizing school’s property! 6.	Took Short Breaks While Sharpening Pencils Remember co-ordinating with your best friend in class and reaching the dustbin place in the corner of your classroom in order to sharpen your pencil, at the exact same time? We’d sharpen our pencil for hardly a minute but stand there talking for a good five minutes, pretending to still sharpen our pencils. 7. Stolen Chalks Admit it; you have all done this at some point of your school life for sure. How else did you get the pieces of chalk when the impromptu chalk fight broke in class? We all felt like we were being rebels by stealing chalks from our teachers and just keeping them hidden with us until something important, for example an impromptu chalk fight took place! 8.	Eaten During Class It was very difficult to resist yourself from eating the delicious snacks that mummy used to pack in your steel tiffin boxes. So instead of waiting for the recess, we have all, at least once, opened up the tiffin box under our tables, while the teacher was still present in class and stuffed our mouths with food! 9.	Taken Longer Routes Back To Class After every PT class, we’d try our level best to separate ourselves from the entire class and take the longer route back to class. This was done with the sole purpose of wandering around in the corridors and doing our bit to waste the teacher’s time who had to take the next period! 10.	Forced Our Parents to Buy Books From The Book Fair At The Open House Every Indian school has a tradition of having a book fair on the same day as the open house. So after meeting our teachers we’d rush our parents to the book fair and force them to buy us the fanciest story books, out of which we’d read maybe one or two only! Those were the best days of our life. Thinking about those days leaves a huge smile on our faces, even today. Only if we could freeze time, relive these moments and then relive them even some more! Share this with your school mates and remind them about the fun and camaraderie that you shared!</p>

                    <h5>Virtual Learning - Can It Replace The Teacher??</h5>
                    <h6>By <span> Nithin , intern at InTuition acadeME</span></h6>

                    <!-- <img src="http://pngimg.com/uploads/student/student_PNG62543.png" alt=""id="blogim g"> -->
                  <p id="blog2" class="collapse">In this rapidly evolving world, knowledge is considered to be just a click away. The traditional books have given way to e-books and the brick and mortar classrooms have given way to virtual classrooms. Tire term virtual learning, stems front the concept of Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Virtual learning is also known as e-learning or ed. tech. A Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) is a set of teaching and learning tools, which incorporate the computers and the internet as important components of the education process. They are in a way designed to enlace the learning experience of the student. Instant messaging (that), wilds and weblogs, discussion forums, audio and video conferencing, e-mail, smart boards, online ;games and activities, internet and computer software’s all come under the umbrella of VLE This concept is slowly gaining popularity owing to the benefits it offers. Virtual learning has completely revolutionized the education sector in India. A student is no longer dependent on a teacher and the classroom teaching has transcended the four walls of the classroom_ The student has an access to learning irrespective of his geographic location. The student can learn a concept and test his knowledge in the privacy and comfort of his home Weaker students can escape from the shame of facing a classroom full of students and can work on improving their scores. Virtual learning thus improves their confidence and provides positive motivation for learning. The student centered teaching approaches of virtual learning reduce students’ dependence on teachers and make them more confident. The online course and classrooms provide the freedom to choose from the given set of topics or syllabus rather than study something forcibly to the students. Apart from this virtual learning also offers pedagogical benefits like increasing confidence of students, providing reinforcement and positive motivation... Virtual learning has come as a breeze of fresh air For all those, who fob it difficult to relate to the concept of classroom teaching. With Information Technology (IT) taking the driver's seat, the concepts are explained using the best possible techniques which are way better than the traditional blackboard model. It engage., young people and provides the freedom of learning at their own pace. Many students prefer online modules over classroom teaching because of the way in which the topics have been explained in a simplified manner. Incorporation of social media like Face book groups, discussion forums and webbings help to capture the interest of the students. Virtual learning leads to increased online discussion and further understanding of the topic at hand. E.-learning is especially used for mobile learning or web learning modules of distant education courses. People can access the learning modules on the go. Rural and backward areas, which do not have facilities for higher education, can greatly benefits from this concept. Students, housewives, working.people and even farmers can increase their knowledge and improve their skills through virtual learning courses. Virtual learning can thus help us in achieving 'education for all'. All said and done, never ever can technology substitute a teacher in a students life. Over the years, the schools have been the learning grounds for the students. Right from interacting with the people and learning the art of socializing, the schools have muds more to offer. The students are exposed to different competitive environments which play an important role in the building and shaping of an individual's personality. Schools and classrooms snake the child learn the art of accepting failures graciously. During the grossing years of one's life, it is the teacher who is always there as a friend, guide, mentor and support for the students. On the other hand, virtual learning works on the principles of impersonal teaching and minimum social interaction. It offers no face-to- face contact and in the end long-term learning suffers. In no way can virtual learning be a substitute for teachers. Technology plays the supporting role, but it is the teacher. who brings it all together. These days many schools are going in for smart classes. In fact, such arrangements will require an active participation of the teacher in order to resolve the queries of the students, Although, the names of such platforms are promoted as interactive platforms, it is the interaction between the children and the teacher which adds re the interactivity quotient. The students need to understand the fact that the online learning portals have been made easy by a set of educators and teachers who along with the technical people have simplified things for them. These can definitely act as an aid to the student for his development, but they can never replace a teacher. In the case, a system suddenly suffers from some software or hardware breakdown, it is the teaches who will come to their rescue. Undoubtedly, personalized tech-infused learning is the future of education. The role of technology in a teacher's life needs to be that of her aids. The Different offerings of the technology .11-St be used. to share some of theintegrator and workload of teacher_ The teacher, who are a part early adopter, part ntegrator and port mad scientist are required by the system at present. The catch over here is that the modem teacher must be willing to take chances and be able to figure out how the technology works, but what is more important is that they understands how it works for each student and where its use is most appropriate. Instead of showing excessive dependency on the technology, the teachers need to incorporate the use of technology in their routine endeavors. The internet can be used to make the boring lectures interesting and assignments more challenging The modern technological gadgets should be limited to one port of a teacher's tool kit. The complete arena of the virtual learning is based on the fact that the computers and the interact Are used to teach the students. This somehow defies the basic principles of education. In an online world, there is nobody to guide, teach and male the students learn the social skills, which are of paramount importance. Moreover, creation of virtual learning modules is a costly process and requires a team of educators, teachers, graphic designers and technical people Virtual learning is an emerging concept which can greatly help to bridge the learning gap and prove to be an excellent teaching aid in the classroom. However, different students respond differently to online learning rara.digni. Some students are very comfortable in working with technology while the less techno-&- mry students have the problem of getting left behind the success of virtual learning depends on the individual's personal learning style, flexibility to adopt to online learning programmers, personal motivation and ability to work through problems on their own. Every student responds differently to e-learning mixtures. Thus, it becomes the responsibility of the teacher to use technology to her advantage and cater to the needs of every student . The teachers have played the role of mentors, guides, leaders and facilitators in the lives of the students. They have encouraged, motivated and inspired the students to aspire, dream and fulfill their desires This is something which no robot or artificial intelligence machinery can do. This type of warmth and personal care offered by the teacher can in no way be substituted by a machine Thus, we can say that virtual learning resources can revolutionize the teaching learning process, but they Cannot completely replace the teacher.</p>
